# What is AFRETEC?
The African Engineering and Technology Network (AFRETEC) is a collaborative initiative among technology-focused universities across Africa. Its purpose is to serve as a platform for collaboration in teaching, research, learning, knowledge creation, and entrepreneurship activities within the engineering and technology field.

Led by Carnegie Mellon University Africa, the network, currently in its foundational stage, aims to include ten technology-focused universities. Present participants include the American University in Cairo, the University of Lagos, the University of Nairobi, the University of Rwanda, and the University of the Witwatersrand.


# Vision of the AFRETEC health cluster

In light of Africa's healthcare disparities—having only 3% of the world's healthcare workers while bearing 25% of the global disease burden and accessing less than 1% of the world's financial resources—the AFRETEC Health Cluster envisions becoming a research-led healthcare innovation hub in Africa. 

In pursuit of its vision, the AFRETEC Health Cluster aims to lead the way in developing affordable, sustainable, and context-specific healthcare solutions. Emphasizing the unique challenges and opportunities within local populations, the cluster envisions pioneering research-led innovations aligned with the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) through the impactful use of ICT and AI technology.

# Aims and Objectives
- Advance impact-oriented research in health for low-resource settings, focusing on tailored solutions and promoting the commercialization of research results.
- Foster research collaboration among African institutions, enhancing the quality and quantity of African-led research and involving international partners.
- Bridge the gap between research and policy through evidence-based and high-impact research, translating findings into practical policies.
- Support the development of African research capacity through training, mentorship, and attracting funding opportunities.
- Facilitate knowledge creation and dissemination.
- Cultivate a culture of innovation and entrepreneurship, encouraging creative solutions to Africa's unique healthcare challenges.
